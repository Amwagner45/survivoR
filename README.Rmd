# survivoR <img src='dev/images/hex.png' align="right" height="240" />

`r max_eps` episodes. `r n_people` people. 1 package!

survivoR is a collection of data sets detailing events across `r max_seasons` seasons of Survivor US, Survivor Australia, Survivor South Africa and Survivor New Zealand. It includes castaway information, vote history, immunity and reward challenge winners, jury votes, advantage details and heaps more!

# Installation

Now on CRAN (<img src='https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/survivoR'/>) or Git (`r version`).

If Git > CRAN I'd suggest install from Git. We are constantly improving the data sets so the github version is likely to be slightly improved.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("survivoR")

# Dataset overview

## Season summary

A table containing summary details of each season of Survivor, including the winner, runner ups and location. 

```{r}
season_summary
```

## Castaways

This data set contains season and demographic information about each castaway. It is structured to view their results for each season. Castaways that have played in multiple seasons will feature more than once with the age and location representing that point in time. Castaways that re-entered the game will feature more than once in the same season as they technically have more than one boot order e.g. Natalie Anderson - Winners at War.

Each castaway has a unique `castaway_id` which links the individual across all data sets and seasons. It also links to the following ID's found on the `vote_history`, `jury_votes` and `challenges` data sets.

* `vote_id`
* `voted_out_id`
* `finalist_id`

```{r}
castaways |> 
  filter(season == 42)
```

### Castaway details

A few castaways have changed their name from season to season or have been referred to by a different name during the season e.g. Amber Mariano; in season 8 Survivor All-Stars there was Rob C and Rob M. That information has been retained here in the `castaways` data set. 

`castaway_details` contains unique information for each castaway. It takes the full name from their most current season and their most verbose short name which is handy for labelling.

It also includes gender, date of birth, occupation, race and ethnicity data. If no source was found to determine a castaways race and ethnicity, the data is kept as missing rather than making an assumption.


```{r}
castaway_details
```


## Vote history

This data frame contains a complete history of votes cast across all seasons of Survivor. This allows you to see who who voted for who at which Tribal Council. It also includes details on who had individual immunity as well as who had their votes nullified by a hidden immunity idol. This details the key events for the season. 

```{r}
vh <- vote_history |> 
  filter(
    season == 42,
    episode == 9
  ) 
vh
```

```{r}
vh |> 
  count(vote)
```


## Challenges

Note: From v1.1 the `challenge_results` dataset has been improved but could break existing code. The old table is maintained at `challenge_results_dep`

There are two tables `challenge_results` and `challenge_description`.

### Challenge results

A tidy data frame of immunity and reward challenge results. The winners and losers of the challenges are found recorded here.

```{r}
challenge_results |> 
  filter(season == 42) |> 
  group_by(castaway) |> 
  summarise(
    won = sum(result == "Won"),
    Lost = sum(result == "Lost"),
    total_challenges = n(),
    chose_for_reward = sum(chosen_for_reward)
  )
```

The `challenge_id` is the primary key for the `challenge_description` data set. The `challange_id` will change as the data or descriptions change. 

TODO: Each challenge must have an ID and link to challenge description


### Challenge description

Note: This data frame is going through a massive revamp. Stay tuned.

This data set contains descriptive binary fields for each challenge. Challenges can go by different names but where possible recurring challenges are kept consistent. While there are tweaks to the challenges, where the main components of the challenge is consistent, they share the same name. 

The features of each challenge have been determined largely through string searches of key words that describe the challenge. It may not capture the full essence of the challenge but on the whole will provide a good basis for analysis. 
Since the description is simply a short paragraph or sentence it may not flag all appropriate features. If any descriptive features need altering please let me know in the [issues](https://github.com/doehm/survivoR/issues).

Features:

* `puzzle`: If the challenge contains a puzzle element.
* `race`: If the challenge is a race between tribes, teams or individuals.
* `precision`: If the challenge contains a precision element e.g. shooting an arrow, hitting a target, etc.
* `endurance`: If the challenge is an endurance event e.g. last tribe, team, individual standing.
* `strength`: If the challenge is largerly strength based e.g. Shoulder the Load.
* `turn_based`: If the challenge is conducted in a series of rounds until a certain amount of points are scored or there is one player remaining.
* `balance`: If the challenge contains a balancing element.
* `food`: If the challenge contains a food element e.g. the food challenge, biting off chunks of meat.
* `knowledge`: If the challenge contains a knowledge component e.g. Q and A about the location.
* `memory`: If the challenge contains a memory element e.g. memorising a sequence of items.
* `fire`: If the challenge contains an element of fire making / maintaining.
* `water`: If the challenge is held, in part, in the water.

```{r}
challenge_description

challenge_description |> 
  summarise_if(is_logical, sum)
```


## Jury votes

History of jury votes. It is more verbose than it needs to be, however having a 0-1 column indicating if a vote was placed or not makes it easier to summarise castaways that received no votes.

```{r jury votes}
jury_votes |> 
  filter(season == 42)
```

```{r jury votes sum}
jury_votes |> 
  filter(season == 42) |> 
  group_by(finalist) |> 
  summarise(votes = sum(vote))
```


## Advantages

### Advantage Details

This dataset lists the hidden idols and advantages in the game for all seasons. It details where it was found, if there was a clue to the advantage, location and other advantage conditions. This maps to the `advantage_movement` table.

```{r}
advantage_details |> 
  filter(season == 42)
```
### Advantage Movement

The `advantage_movement` table tracks who found the advantage, who they may have handed it to and who the played it for. Each step is called an event. The `sequence_id` tracks the logical step of the advantage. For example in season 41, JD found an Extra Vote advantage. JD gave it to Shan in good faith who then voted him out keeping the Extra Vote. Shan gave it to Ricard in good faith who eventually gave it back before Shan played it for Naseer. That movement is recorded in this table.

```{r}
advantage_movement |> 
  filter(advantage_id == "USEV4102")
```

## Confessionals

A dataset containing the number of confessionals for each castaway by season and episode. The data has been counted by contributors of the survivoR R package and consolidated with external sources. The aim is to establish consistency in confessional counts in the absence of official sources. Given the subjective nature of the counts and the potential for clerical error no single source is more valid than another. Therefore, it is reasonable to average across all sources.

```{r}
confessionals |> 
  filter(season == 42) |> 
  group_by(castaway) |> 
  summarise(n_confessionals = sum(confessional_count))
```

## Screen time [EXPERIMENTAL]

This dataset contains the estimated screen time for each castaway during an episode. Please note that this is still in the early days of development. There is likely to be misclassifcation and other sources of error. The model will be refined over time.

An individuals' screen time is calculated, at a high-level, via the following process:

1. Frames are sampled from episodes on a 1 second time interval

2. MTCNN detects the human faces within each frame

3. VGGFace2 converts each detected face into a 512d vector space

4. A training set of labelled images (1 for each contestant + 3 for Jeff Probst) is processed in the same way to determine where they sit in the vector space. TODO: This could be made more accurate by increasing the number of training images per contestant.

5. The Euclidean distance is calculated for the faces detected in the frame to each of the contestants in the season (+Jeff). If the minimum distance is greater than 1.2 the face is labelled as "unknown". TODO: Review how robust this distance cutoff truly is - currently based on manual review of Season 42.

6. A multi-class SVM is trained on the training set to label faces. For any face not identified as "unknown", the vector embedding is run into this model and a label is generated.

7. All labelled faces are aggregated together, with an assumption of 1-5 full second of screen time each time a face is seen and factoring in time between detection capping at a max of 5 seconds.

<img src='dev/images/cast-detect1.png' align="center"/>

```{r}
screen_time |> 
  filter(version_season == "US42") |> 
  group_by(castaway_id) |> 
  summarise(total_mins = sum(screen_time)/60) |> 
  left_join(
    castaway_details |> 
      select(castaway_id, castaway = short_name),
    by = "castaway_id"
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(total_mins))
```

Currently it only includes data for season 42. More seasons will be added as they are completed.


## Tribe mapping

A mapping for castaways to tribes for each day (day being the day of the tribal council). This is useful for observing who is on what tribe throughout the game. Each season by day holds a complete list of castaways still in the game and which tribe they are on. Moving through each day you can observe the changes in the tribe. For example the first day (usual day 2) has all castaways mapped to their original tribe. The next day has the same minus the castaway just voted out. This is useful for observing the changes in tribe make either due to castaways being voted off the island, tribe swaps, who is on Redemption Island and Edge of Extinction.

```{r}
tribe_mapping |> 
  filter(season == 42)
```

## Boot Mapping

A mapping table for easily filtering to the set of castaways that are still in the game after a specified number of boots. How this differs from the tribe mapping is that rather than being focused on an episode, it is focused on the boot which is often more useful. This is useful for filtering to who is still alive in the game for a given episode and number of boots. When someone quits the game or is medically evacuated it is considered a boot. This table tracks multiple boots per episode.

```{r}
# filter to season 42 and when there are 6 people left
# 18 people in the season, therefore 12 boots

still_alive <- function(.version, .season, .n_boots) {
  survivoR::boot_mapping |>
    filter(
      version == .version,
      season == .season,
      order == .n_boots,
      game_status %in% c("In the game", "Returned")
    )
}

still_alive("US", 42, 12)
```


## Viewers

A data frame containing the viewer information for every episode across all seasons. It also includes the rating and viewer share information for viewers aged 18 to 49 years of age.

```{r viewers}
viewers |> 
  filter(season == 42)
```


## Tribe colours

This data frame contains the tribe names and colours for each season, including the RGB values. These colours can be joined with the other data frames to customise colours for plots. Another option is to add tribal colours to ggplots with the scale functions. 

```{r tribe colours}
tribe_colours
```

<img src='dev/images/tribe-colours.png' align="center"/>

# Scale functions

Included are ggplot2 scale functions of the form <code>scale_fill_survivor()</code> and <code>scale_fill_tribes()</code> to add season and tribe colours to ggplot. The <code>scale_fill_survivor()</code> scales uses a colour palette extracted from the season logo and <code>scale_fill_tribes()</code> scales uses the tribal colours of the specified season as a colour palette. 

All that is required for the 'survivor' palettes is the desired season as input. If not season is provided it will default to season 40.

<img src='dev/images/season-40-logo.png' align="center"/>

```{r survivor scales, eval = FALSE}
castaways |> 
  distinct(season, castaway_id) |> 
  left_join(
    castaway_details |> 
      select(castaway_id, personality_type),
    by = "castaway_id"
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = n, fill = personality_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_survivor(40) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src='dev/images/survivor-pal-example.png' align="center"/>

Below are the palettes for all seasons.

<img src='dev/images/palettes1.png' align="center"/>

<img src='dev/images/palettes2.png' align="center"/>

To use the tribe scales, simply input the season number desired to use those tribe colours. If the fill or colour aesthetic is the tribe name, this needs to be passed to the scale function as <code>scale_fill_tribes(season, tribe = tribe)</code> (for now) where <code>tribe</code> is on the input data frame. If the fill or colour aesthetic is independent from the actual tribe names, like gender for example, <code>tribe</code> does not need to be specified and will simply use the tribe colours as a colour palette, such as the viewers line graph above.

```{r tribe scales, eval = FALSE}
ssn <- 35
labels <- castaways |>
  filter(
    season == ssn,
    str_detect(result, "Sole|unner")
  ) |>
  mutate(label = glue("{castaway} ({original_tribe})")) |>
  select(label, castaway)

jury_votes |>
  filter(season == ssn) |>
  left_join(
    castaways |>
      filter(season == ssn) |>
      select(castaway, original_tribe),
    by = "castaway"
  ) |>
  group_by(finalist, original_tribe) |>
  summarise(votes = sum(vote)) |>
  left_join(labels, by = c("finalist" = "castaway")) |>
  {
    ggplot(., aes(x = label, y = votes, fill = original_tribe)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +
      scale_fill_tribes(ssn, tribe = .$original_tribe) +
      theme_minimal() +
      labs(
        x = "Finalist (original tribe)",
        y = "Votes",
        fill = "Original\ntribe",
        title = "Votes received by each finalist"
      )
  }
```

```{r save tribal, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ggsave("dev/images/votes.png", height = 4, width = 8)
```

<img src='dev/images/votes.png' align="center"/>

# Issues

Given the variable nature of the game of Survivor and changing of the rules, there are bound to be edges cases where the data is not quite right. Before logging an issue please install the git version to see if it has already been corrected. If not, please log an issue and I will correct the datasets.

New features will be added, such as details on exiled castaways across the seasons. If you have a request for specific data let me know in the issues and I'll see what I can do. Also, if you'd like to contribute by adding to existing datasets or contribute a new dataset, please [contact me directly](http://gradientdescending.com/contact/).

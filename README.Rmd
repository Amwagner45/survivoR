596 episodes. 40 seasons. 1 package!


survivoR is a collection of data sets detailing events across all 40 seasons of the US Survivor, including castaway information, vote history, immunity and reward challenge winners and jury votes.

# Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("doehm/survivoR")
```


# Dataset overview

## Season summary

A table containing summary details of each season of Survivor, including the winner, runner ups and location. Note this is a nested data frame given there may be 1 or 2 runner ups. The grain is maintained to 1 row per season.

```{r}
season_summary
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
season_summary %>%
  select(season, viewers_premier, viewers_finale, viewers_reunion, viewers_mean) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -season, names_to = "episode", values_to = "viewers") %>%
  mutate(
    episode = to_title_case(str_replace(episode, "viewers_", ""))
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = viewers, colour = episode)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_colour_survivor(16) +
  labs(
    title = "Survivor viewers over the 40 seasons",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Viewers (Millions)",
    colour = "Episode"
  )
```

## Castaways

Season and demographic information about each castaway. Within a season the data is order by the first voted out to sole survivor indicated by order. When demographic information is missing, it likely means that the castaway re-entered the game at a later stage by winning the opportunity to return. Castaways that have played in multiple seasons will feature more than once with the age and location representing that point in time.

```{r}
castaways %>% 
  filter(season == 40)
```

## Vote history

This data frame contains a complete history of votes cast across all seasons of Survivor. This allows you to see who who voted for who at which tribal council. It also includes details on who had individual immunity as well as who had their votes nullified by a hidden immunity idol. This details the key events for the season. 

```{r}
vh <- vote_history %>% 
  filter(
    season == 40,
    episode == 10
  )
vh
```

```{r}
vh %>% 
  count(vote)
```

## Immunity

A nested tidy data frame of immunity challenge results. Each row is a tribal council. There may be multiple people or tribes that win immunity which can be determined by expanding the data set. There may be duplicates for the rare event when there are multiple eliminations after a single immunity challenged.

```{r}
immunity %>% 
  filter(season == 40) %>% 
  unnest(immunity)
```

## Rewards

A nested data frame of reward challenge results. Typically in the merge, if a single person win a reward they are allowed to bring others along with them. The first castaway in the expanded list is likely to be the winner and the subsequent players those they brought along with them. Although, not always. Occasionally in the merge the castaways are split into two teams for the purpose of the reward, in which case all castaways win the reward rather than a single person.

```{r}
rewards %>% 
  filter(season == 40) %>% 
  unnest(reward)
```


## Jury votes

History of jury votes. It is more verbose than it needs to be, however having a 0-1 column indicating if a vote was placed or not makes it easier to summarise castaways that received no votes.

```{r}
jury_votes %>% 
  filter(season == 40)
```

```{r}
jury_votes %>% 
  filter(season == 40) %>% 
  group_by(finalist) %>% 
  summarise(votes = sum(vote))
```

## Viewers

A data frame containing the viewer information for every episode across all sesasons. It also includes the rating and viewer share information for viewers aged 18 to 49 years of age.

```{r}
viewers %>% 
  filter(season == 40)
```


## Tribe colours

This data frame contains the tribe names and colours for each season, including the RGB values. These colours can be joined with the other data frames to customise colours for plots. Another option is to add tribal colours to ggplots with the scale functions. 

```{r}
tribe_colours
```

# Scale functions

Included are ggplot2 scale functions (of the form <code>scale_*_survivor()</code>) to add tribe colours to ggplot. Simply input the season number desired to use those tribe colours. If the fill or colour aesthetic is the tribe name, this needs to be passed to the scale function as <code>scale_fill_survivor(..., tribe = tribe)</code> (for now) where <code>tribe</code> is on the input data frame. If the fill or colour aesthetic is independent from the actual tribe names, like gender for example, <code>tribe</code> does not need to be specified and will simply use the tribe colours as a colour palette, such as the viewers line graph above.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ssn <- 35
labels <- castaways %>% 
  filter(
    season == ssn, 
    str_detect(result, "Sole|unner")
  ) %>% 
  select(castaway, original_tribe) %>% 
  mutate(label = glue("{castaway} ({original_tribe})")) %>% 
  select(label, castaway)
jury_votes %>% 
  filter(season == ssn) %>% 
  left_join(
    castaways %>% 
      filter(season == ssn) %>% 
      select(castaway, original_tribe),
    by = "castaway"
    ) %>% 
  group_by(finalist, original_tribe) %>% 
  summarise(votes = sum(vote)) %>% 
  left_join(labels, by = c("finalist" = "castaway")) %>% {
    ggplot(., aes(x = label, y = votes, fill = original_tribe)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +
    scale_fill_survivor(ssn, tribe = .$original_tribe) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(
      x = "Finalist (original tribe)",
      y = "Votes",
      fill = "Original\ntribe",
      title = "Votes received by each finalist"
    )
  }
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ggsave("man/dev/images/votes.png", height = 4, width = 8)
```

# Issues

Given the variable nature of the game of Survivor and changing of the rules, there are bound to be edges cases where the data is not quite right. Please log an issue and I will correct the datasets.

New features will be added, such as details on exiled castaways across the seasons. If you have a request for specific data let me know in the issues and I'll see what I can do. Also, if you'd like to contribute by adding to existing datasets or contribute a new dataset, please [contact me directly](http://gradientdescending.com/contact/).

# survivoR <img src='dev/images/hex-torch.png' align="right" height="240" />

`r max_eps` episodes. `r max(survivoR::viewers$season)` seasons. 1 package!

survivoR is a collection of data sets detailing events across all 41 seasons of the US Survivor, including castaway information, vote history, immunity and reward challenge winners and jury votes.

# Installation

Now on CRAN (v1.0.1).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("survivoR")
```

Or install from Git for the latest (`r str_replace(readLines("DESCRIPTION")[4], 'Version: ', 'v')`). We are constantly improving the data sets and the github version is likely to be slightly improved.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("doehm/survivoR")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
n_eps <- viewers |> 
  filter(season == 9, version == "SA") |> 
  summarise(n = max(episode, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  pull(n)
```

# Changes for v2.0

For v2.0 all Non US seasons of Survivor will be added to the package. This has the potential to break current analysis scripts. When these seasons are added there will be multiple season 1, 2, etc. This means any join or filter on `season` is going either going to error out or create duplicate rows. It is recommended that all joins and filters on season are either replaced with `version_season` or include `version`. 

You can try it out using `import_non_us_data()`. This imports all versions currently available. After importing you need to restart R and load the library again. BIG WARNING! This is still largely in development and far from complete. Use with caution.

Example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
import_non_us_data()
#> 
#> Non US data loaded
#> 1. Restart session
#> 2. Run library(survivoR)
```

The data is collated and stored in a list. The following code returns all season 1's available in the data set. You can see how joins will fail when directly joined on state alone.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
castaways |> 
  filter(season == 1) |> 
  distinct(version_season, castaway_id) |> 
  count(version_season)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 2
#>   version_season     n
#>   <chr>          <int>
#> 1 AU01              24
#> 2 US01              16
```

To filter to just the US version we need to add in `version == "US"`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
castaways |> 
  filter(
    version == "US",
    season == 1
    ) |> 
  distinct(version_season, castaway_id) |> 
  count(version_season)
#> # A tibble: 1 × 2
#>   version_season     n
#>   <chr>          <int>
#> 1 US01              16
```

To return to just using the US data by default run `remove_non_us_data`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remove_non_us_data()
#> 
#> Non US data removed
#> 1. Restart session
#> 2. Run library(survivoR)
```

Restart R and load the library

  )
```

## Castaways

This data set contains season and demographic information about each castaway. It is structured to view their results for each season. Castaways that have played in multiple seasons will feature more than once with the age and location representing that point in time. Castaways that re-entered the game will feature more than once in the same season as they technically have more than one boot order e.g. Natalie Anderson - Winners at War.

Each castaway has a unique `castaway_id` which links the individual across all data sets and seasons. It also links to the following ID's found on the `vote_history`, `jury_votes` and `challenges` data sets.

* `vote_id`
* `voted_out_id`
* `finalist_id`
* `winner_id`


```{r}
castaways |> 
  filter(season == 41)
```

### Castaway details

A few castaways have changed their name from season to season or have been referred to by a different name during the season e.g. Amber Mariano; in season 8 Survivor All-Stars there was Rob C and Rob M. That information has been retained here in the `castaways` data set. 

`castaway_details` contains unique information for each castaway. It takes the full name from their most current season and their most verbose short name which is handy for labelling.

It also includes gender, date of birth, occupation, race and ethnicity data. If no source was found to determine a castaways race and ethnicity, the data is kept as missing rather than making an assumption.


```{r}
castaway_details
```


## Vote history

This data frame contains a complete history of votes cast across all seasons of Survivor. This allows you to see who who voted for who at which Tribal Council. It also includes details on who had individual immunity as well as who had their votes nullified by a hidden immunity idol. This details the key events for the season. 

```{r}
vh <- vote_history |> 
  filter(
    season == 41,
    episode == 9
  ) 
vh
```

```{r}
vh |> 
  count(vote)
```

Events in the game such as fire challenges, rock draws, steal-a-vote advantages or countbacks in the early days often mean a vote wasn't placed for an individual. Rather a challenge may be won, lost, no vote cast but attended Tribal Council, etc. These events are recorded in the <code>vote</code> field. I have included a function <code>clean_votes</code> for when only need the votes cast for individuals. If the input data frame has the <code>vote</code> column it can simply be piped.

```{r}
vh |> 
  clean_votes() |> 
  count(vote)
```


## Challenges

The `challenge_results` and `challenge_description` data sets supersede the `challenges` data set.

### Challenge results

A nested tidy data frame of immunity and reward challenge results. The winners and winning tribe of the challenge are found by expanding the `winners` column. For individual immunity challenges the winning tribe is simply `NA`.

```{r}
challenge_results |> 
  filter(season == 41)
```

Typically in the merge if a single person win a reward they are allowed to bring others along with them. This is identified by `outcome_status` column. If it states `Chosen to particpate` it means they were chosen by the winner to particpate in the reward.

The `day` field on this data set represents the day of the tribal council rather than the day of the challenge. This is to more easily associate the reward challenge with the immunity challenge and result of the tribal council. It also helps for joining tables.

The `challenge_id` is the primary key for the `challenge_description` data set. The `challange_id` will change as the data or descriptions change.

### Challenge description

This data set contains descriptive binary fields for each challenge. Challenges can go by different names but where possible recurring challenges are kept consistent. While there are tweaks to the challenges, where the main components of the challenge is consistent, they share the same name. 

The features of each challenge have been determined largely through string searches of key words that describe the challenge. It may not capture the full essence of the challenge but on the whole will provide a good basis for analysis. 
Since the description is simply a short paragraph or sentence it may not flag all appropriate features. If any descriptive features need altering please let me know in the [issues](https://github.com/doehm/survivoR/issues).

Features:

* `puzzle`: If the challenge contains a puzzle element.
* `race`: If the challenge is a race between tribes, teams or individuals.
* `precision`: If the challenge contains a precision element e.g. shooting an arrow, hitting a target, etc.
* `endurance`: If the challenge is an endurance event e.g. last tribe, team, individual standing.
* `strength`: If the challenge is largerly strength based e.g. Shoulder the Load.
* `turn_based`: If the challenge is conducted in a series of rounds until a certain amount of points are scored or there is one player remaining.
* `balance`: If the challenge contains a balancing element.
* `food`: If the challenge contains a food element e.g. the food challenge, biting off chunks of meat.
* `knowledge`: If the challenge contains a knowledge component e.g. Q and A about the location.
* `memory`: If the challenge contains a memory element e.g. memorising a sequence of items.
* `fire`: If the challenge contains an element of fire making / maintaining.
* `water`: If the challenge is held, in part, in the water.

```{r}
challenge_description

challenge_description |> 
  summarise_if(is_logical, sum)
```


## Jury votes

History of jury votes. It is more verbose than it needs to be, however having a 0-1 column indicating if a vote was placed or not makes it easier to summarise castaways that received no votes.

```{r jury votes}
jury_votes |> 
  filter(season == 41)
```

```{r jury votes sum}
jury_votes |> 
  filter(season == 41) |> 
  group_by(finalist) |> 
  summarise(votes = sum(vote))
```


## Advantages

### Advantage Details

This dataset lists the hidden idols and advantages in the game for all seasons. It details where it was found, if there was a clue to the advantage, location and other advantage conditions. This maps to the `advantage_movement` table.

```{r}
advantage_details |> 
  filter(season == 41)
```
### Advantage Movement

The `advantage_movement` table tracks who found the advantage, who they may have handed it to and who the played it for. Each step is called an event. The `sequence_id` tracks the logical step of the advantage. For example in season 41, JD found an Extra Vote advantage. JD gave it to Shan in good faith who then voted him out keeping the Extra Vote. Shan gave it to Ricard in good faith who eventually gave it back before Shan played it for Naseer. That movement is recorded in this table.

```{r}
advantage_movement |> 
  filter(advantage_id == "USEV4102")
```

## Confessionals

A dataset containing the number of confessionals for each castaway by season and episode. The data has been counted by contributors of the survivoR R package and consolidated with external sources. The aim is to establish consistency in confessional counts in the absence of official sources. Given the subjective nature of the counts and the potential for clerical error no single source is more valid than another. Therefore, it is reasonable to average across all sources.

```{r}
confessionals |> 
  filter(season == 41) |> 
  group_by(castaway) |> 
  summarise(n_confessionals = sum(confessional_count))
```

## Tribe mapping

A mapping for castaways to tribes for each day (day being the day of the tribal council). This is useful for observing who is on what tribe throughout the game. Each season by day holds a complete list of castaways still in the game and which tribe they are on. Moving through each day you can observe the changes in the tribe. For example the first day (usual day 2) has all castaways mapped to their original tribe. The next day has the same minus the castaway just voted out. This is useful for observing the changes in tribe make either due to castaways being voted off the island, tribe swaps, who is on Redemption Island and Edge of Extinction.

```{r}
tribe_mapping |> 
  filter(season == 41)
```

## Boot Mapping

A mapping table for easily filtering to the set of castaways that are still in the game after a specified number of boots. How this differs from the tribe mapping is that rather than being focused on an episode, it is focused on the boot which is often more useful. This table can be used to calculate how many people participated in certain challenges once mapped to `challenge_results`. 

When someone quits the game or is medically evacuated it is considered a boot. This table tracks multiple boots per episode.

```{r}
# filter to season 41 and when there are 6 people left
# 18 people in the season, therefore 12 boots

boot_mapping |> 
  filter(
    season == 41,
    order == 12
    )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
df_chal <- challenge_results |> 
  unnest(winners) |> 
  filter(
    season == 41,
    order == 12
    ) |> 
  distinct(season, episode, order, challenge_name, challenge_type, outcome_type, winner, outcome_status)

bm <- boot_mapping |> 
  filter(
    season == 41,
    order == 12
    ) 

bm |> 
  left_join(df_chal, by = c("season", "episode", "order", "castaway" = "winner"))
```


## Viewers

A data frame containing the viewer information for every episode across all seasons. It also includes the rating and viewer share information for viewers aged 18 to 49 years of age.

```{r viewers}
viewers |> 
  filter(season == 41)
```


## Tribe colours

This data frame contains the tribe names and colours for each season, including the RGB values. These colours can be joined with the other data frames to customise colours for plots. Another option is to add tribal colours to ggplots with the scale functions. 

```{r tribe colours}
tribe_colours
```

<img src='dev/images/tribe-colours.png' align="center"/>

# Scale functions

Included are ggplot2 scale functions of the form <code>scale_fill_survivor()</code> and <code>scale_fill_tribes()</code> to add season and tribe colours to ggplot. The <code>scale_fill_survivor()</code> scales uses a colour palette extracted from the season logo and <code>scale_fill_tribes()</code> scales uses the tribal colours of the specified season as a colour palette. 

All that is required for the 'survivor' palettes is the desired season as input. If not season is provided it will default to season 40.

<img src='dev/images/season-40-logo.png' align="center"/>

```{r survivor scales, eval = FALSE}
castaways |> 
  distinct(season, castaway_id) |> 
  left_join(
    castaway_details |> 
      select(castaway_id, personality_type),
    by = "castaway_id"
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = n, fill = personality_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_survivor(40) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<img src='dev/images/survivor-pal-example.png' align="center"/>

Below are the palettes for all seasons.

<img src='dev/images/palettes1.png' align="center"/>

<img src='dev/images/palettes2.png' align="center"/>

To use the tribe scales, simply input the season number desired to use those tribe colours. If the fill or colour aesthetic is the tribe name, this needs to be passed to the scale function as <code>scale_fill_tribes(season, tribe = tribe)</code> (for now) where <code>tribe</code> is on the input data frame. If the fill or colour aesthetic is independent from the actual tribe names, like gender for example, <code>tribe</code> does not need to be specified and will simply use the tribe colours as a colour palette, such as the viewers line graph above.

```{r tribe scales, eval = FALSE}
ssn <- 35
labels <- castaways |>
  filter(
    season == ssn,
    str_detect(result, "Sole|unner")
  ) |>
  mutate(label = glue("{castaway} ({original_tribe})")) |>
  select(label, castaway)

jury_votes |>
  filter(season == ssn) |>
  left_join(
    castaways |>
      filter(season == ssn) |>
      select(castaway, original_tribe),
    by = "castaway"
  ) |>
  group_by(finalist, original_tribe) |>
  summarise(votes = sum(vote)) |>
  left_join(labels, by = c("finalist" = "castaway")) |>
  {
    ggplot(., aes(x = label, y = votes, fill = original_tribe)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.5) +
      scale_fill_tribes(ssn, tribe = .$original_tribe) +
      theme_minimal() +
      labs(
        x = "Finalist (original tribe)",
        y = "Votes",
        fill = "Original\ntribe",
        title = "Votes received by each finalist"
      )
  }
```

```{r save tribal, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ggsave("dev/images/votes.png", height = 4, width = 8)
```

# Issues

Given the variable nature of the game of Survivor and changing of the rules, there are bound to be edges cases where the data is not quite right. Before logging an issue please install the git version to see if it has already been corrected. If not, please log an issue and I will correct the datasets.

New features will be added, such as details on exiled castaways across the seasons. If you have a request for specific data let me know in the issues and I'll see what I can do. Also, if you'd like to contribute by adding to existing datasets or contribute a new dataset, please [contact me directly](http://gradientdescending.com/contact/).
